-> Built a deepfake detection system using MTCNN for face extraction and a hybrid Xception + BiLSTM model to capture spatial and temporal features from video frames.

-> Processed 10 frames per video (224×224), trained using Binary Cross-Entropy loss and Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling.

-> Achieved 90% accuracy, evaluated using confusion matrix, precision, and recall.
